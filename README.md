# **Project Overview**

## **Purpose:**

BasaFinder is a full-stack web application that provides a smart rental housing solution. The platform connects landlords, tenants, and an admin who oversees both users and house listings. Landlords can post and manage rental property listings, while tenants can search for, view, and request rentals. When a landlord approves a rental request, a payment option becomes available to the tenant, and the landlord can provide their phone number for further contact.

## **Key Components:**

### **Roles:**

-   -   **Admin:** Manages all users(Landlords, Tenants) accounts and rental house posts.
    -   **Landlord:** Posts and manages their rental listings, reviews and responds to rental requests.
    -   **Tenant:** Searches for rental houses and submits requests to rent.

### **Security:**

-   -   Custom authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).
    -   Password hashing using bcrypt for secure storage.
    -   Role-based access control to ensure only authorized access to private pages.

----------

### Core Functionalities:

-   -   **Rental House Listings:** Landlords can post detailed rental listings with `rental house location`, `details description`, `rent amount`, `number of bedrooms`, `multiple images`, `landlord ID (to link with the users collection)` and any other necessary details.
    -   **Search & Filter:** Tenants can search rentals by `location`, `price` and `number of bedrooms`.
    -   **Rental Requests:** Tenants can submit rental requests. Landlords can approve/reject them.
    -   **Payment:** When a landlord approves a rental request, a payment option (Stripe, ShurjoPay, etc) is made available on the tenant‚Äôs end to secure the rental.
    -   **Role-Based Dashboards:** Custom dashboards for **Admin**, **Landlords** and **Tenants**.
    -   **Email Notifications:** Automatic updates for rental requests.

----------


## **Backend Features:**

#### **Database Collections (MongoDB):**

1.  1.  **Users Collection**:
        -   **Fields**: `name`, `email`, `phone number`, `password (hashed)`, `role (admin, landlord, tenant)`, and any other necessary details.
        -   Store user credentials and roles for **authentication** and **authorization**.
    2.  **Listings Collection (Rental Houses):**
        -   **Fields**: `rental house location`, `details description`, `rent amount`, `number of bedrooms`, `multiple images`, `landlord ID (to link with the users collection)` , and any other necessary details.
        -   Store details of each rental house listing submitted by Landlords.
    3.  **Requests Collection (Rental Requests):**
        -   **Fields**: `rental house (listing) ID`, `tenant ID (to identify the requesting user)`, `status(pending, approve, reject)`, `(Upon approval) landlord‚Äôs phone number for direct contact`, `payment status (for approved requests)`, additional message or information provided by the tenant
        -   Track all rental requests submitted by Tenants and the corresponding responses by Landlords.

#### **Authentication:**

-   -   Used **JWT** for handling user sessions securely.
    -   Implement **bcrypt** for password hashing to store passwords securely.
    -   **Custom middleware** for protected routes to ensure that only authorized users (admins, landlords, and tenants) can access their respective dashboards and endpoints.

#### **CRUD Operations:**

**The provided routes are examples only. You may add new routes or remove/edit existing ones as necessary to best suit your project's requirements.**

In this project I have used node package manager(npm) to install all kinds of required dependency. I have followed the modular pattern in my project building.

### To run this project locally, what you need to install?

- NODE.JS
- TYPESCRIPT
- EXPRESS.JS
- MONGOOSE
- MONGODB ATLAS / COMPASS

For the better code writing and avoiding unnecessary error I have installed ‚Äî

- TYPESCRIPT ESLINT AND PRETTIER

## The way I have started my project is described bellow‚Äî

# init package.json file

- npm init -y

### Install express, mongoose, typescript [as dev dependency], cors, dotenv

- `npm install express`
- `npm install mongoose --save`
- **npm install typescript --save-dev**
- npm i cors
- npm i dotenv
- npm i bcrypt
- npm i -D @types/bcrypt
- npm i jsonwebtoken
- npm i -D @types/jsonwebtoken

# For typescript init a ts json file

- tsc -init [then in tsconfig.json file update the below lines]
- "rootDir": "./src",
- "outDir": "./dist",

# To run the ts file in js make a script in package.json file in script section

- "build": "tsc",

then run ‚Äî‚Üí  

- npm run build [dist folder will be created and the js files will be available there]

## separate the listening port of mongoose connection in the server.ts file and setup config file for handling the .env file globally in an efficient way.

### Integrating eslint and prettier in the project

- https://blog.logrocket.com/linting-typescript-eslint-prettier/

### To run the ts file directly install the command but it is only for faster developing purpose.

- npm i ts-node-dev
- ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/server.ts  ‚Äî to run the server file

### In the package.json file I have written some scripts to enhance the developing. Scripts are following

```
    "start:prod": "node ./dist/server.js",
    "start:dev": "ts-node-dev --respawn --transpile-only src/server.ts",
    "build": "tsc",
    "lint": "npx eslint src --ignore-pattern '.js,.ts'",
    "lint:fix": "npx eslint src --fix",
    "prettier": "prettier --ignore-path .gitignore --write \"./src/**/*.+(js|ts|json)\"",
    "prettier:fix": "npx prettier --write src",
```

Here, use the command **npm run start:dev**  and others necessary command when it is needed.  

- use start:dev to run the project in the production
- start:dev use for faster project run in the development
- build use for converting ts file into js
- lint, use to check the warnings / error
- lint:fix , use for auto fixing
- prettier, use for check and fix the extra gap.


### For the deployement I have created the vercel.json file. In this file, I have added the public credentials. I have deployed my server in vercel with vercel cli

### Types of Errors Handled

The following common errors will be managed with appropriate responses:

Zod Validation Error (ZOD_ERROR): Errors arising from invalid data inputs based on Zod schema validation.
Not Found Error (NOT_FOUND_ERROR): When requested resources (e.g., a user, item, or page) are not found.
Validation Error (VALIDATION_ERROR): General validation errors (e.g., incorrect data format, missing required fields).
Authentication Error (AUTH_ERROR): Issues related to failed authentication (e.g., invalid token or expired session).
Authorization Error (AUTHORIZATION_ERROR): When the user lacks the necessary permissions to access a resource.
Internal Server Error (INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR): Unhandled errors or unexpected server issues.
